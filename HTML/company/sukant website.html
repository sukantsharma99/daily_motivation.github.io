    <h2>Nicola Tesla</h2>
    <p>
      Nikola Tesla said, “ If you wish to understand the Universe think of
      energy, frequency and vibration. “ ...<br />
      It's our doubt and changing frequencies and our inability to hold thoughts
      and visions for <br />extended times that takes us off our path
    </p>
    <h2>mahatma Gandhi</h2>
    <p>
      You must be the change you wish to see in the world. <br />

      The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.
